## This is a new catkin workspace

	my_robot should be the final package used.

- A total new test packaged shoud be created as test/

UP to now :
	Only use catkin_make in catkin_ws folder can make all paclkages,
	This should be done next!

Could NOT find geographic_msgs (missing: geographic_msgs_DIR)
Could not find the required component 'geographic_msgs'. The following CMake error indicates that you either need to install the package with the same name or change your environment so that it can be found.
